    <h1>I believe in Jesus, what's next?</h1>

    <p>
      After chasing the world for 29 years, by God's grace, I finally came to
      the end of myself, and he said, ARE YOU DONE YET? I finally was done
      trying to manage my own life and I was ready to take it, but God
      interceded. On July 23, 2013, I fully surrendered my life to Christ. God
      let me get to the end of the rope on my own, and then he reached down and
      pulled me up out of the pit of my own despair.
    </p>

    <p>
      That is where you might be today, realizing the depravity of your own sin.
      Ready and willing to surrender and put your full trust in Jesus Christ.
      There is nothing more beautiful than a fully surrendered soul to the
      Creator of all things. Welcome to the adoption into God's family. We are
      so incredibly grateful for you in this moment and the angels are
      rejoicing.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might be wondering, now that I have committed my life to Christ, what
      happens next? The very moment you put your trust in Jesus, the Holy Spirit
      has fully indwelled you, comforting you, giving you an overwhelming peace
      and it will be with you on your journey, for however long God gives you.
      The Holy Spirit will help clean you out of your own sinful nature, it will
      convict you and God will want you to continue to turn to Him to help free
      you from those chains. But we can live in the hope that once you put your
      faith in Jesus you are saved and will never be let out from God's almighty
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are a few things you can do to on your new found journey: Share with
      friends that you called out to God and surrendered your life to Christ.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Get your hands on a Bible (KJV is what I use) and try to read it daily,
        even if its not making much sense at the start.
      </li>
      <li>
        Find a local Bible believing and Bible teaching church who lives and
        teaches the Word of God.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rejoice! The life that God has begun in you will continue and He will
        finish the journey with you, that's his promise.
      </li>
      <li>
        We would love to pray with you, please give us your basic information so
        we can rejoice and continue in prayer for you.
      </li>
